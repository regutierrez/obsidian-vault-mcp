# Obsidian Vault MCP

> **Fork note:** This is a personal fork of [3011/obsidian-vault-mcp](https://github.com/3011/obsidian-vault-mcp). Use the `homelab` branch; `main` tracks upstream. The fork adds two things:
>
> - `vault_edit`, which applies exact-text replacements safely, and a switch to turn off the unrestricted upsert.
> - A better `search_simple`. The upstream version matched the whole query as one exact string and returned the first notes it found, with no total. Everyday questions missed notes that used different wording, and repetitive daily notes filled the results. This fork's search matches words and simple word variants. It ranks titles and aliases highest, shows excerpts and the reasons each note matched, reports `total`/`hasMore` for paging, and can filter by path, tag, and date.
>
> To update from upstream, rebase `homelab` onto `3011/obsidian-vault-mcp` `main` and run `npm test`.

[中文文档](README.zh-CN.md)

Headless Obsidian Vault MCP server backed by a normal Markdown vault directory.

It is designed for:

```text
livesync-cli daemon -> /data/vault -> obsidian-vault-mcp -> ChatGPT Connector
```

It does not depend on Obsidian, plugin APIs, command palette, active files, or GUI state.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository, build the image locally, then start the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3011/obsidian-vault-mcp.git
cd obsidian-vault-mcp
docker build -t obsidian-vault-mcp:local .

mkdir -p "$HOME/obsidian-vault/98-Inbox"
export MCP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -p 8080:8080 \
  -e MCP_TOKEN="$MCP_TOKEN" \
  -v "$HOME/obsidian-vault:/data/vault" \
  obsidian-vault-mcp:local
```

Verify the server at `http://localhost:8080/healthz`, then configure your MCP client with endpoint `http://localhost:8080/mcp` and bearer token `$MCP_TOKEN`.

For Kubernetes and LiveSync deployments, see [`deploy/README.zh-CN.md`](deploy/README.zh-CN.md) and [`docs/deployment-architecture.md`](docs/deployment-architecture.md).

## Tools

- `vault_list`: list vault files and folders.
- `vault_list_detailed`: return structured path facts, file metadata, attachment markers, warnings, and scan IDs.
- `vault_read`: read full note metadata/content or a heading, block, or frontmatter target; read supported text files.
- `vault_write`: deprecated compatibility upsert tool.
- `vault_create_note`: atomically create a new Markdown note without overwriting.
- `vault_replace_note`: replace an existing note only when its raw-byte SHA-256 matches.
- `vault_append`: append content to a Markdown file, creating it if missing.
- `vault_patch`: patch heading, block, or frontmatter targets.
- `vault_delete`: delete a vault file or empty folder.
- `vault_move`: move or rename a vault file.
- `vault_get_operation`: query a WAL-backed move/delete operation.
- `vault_get_document_map`: list headings, block refs, frontmatter fields, links, embeds, and tags.
- `search_simple`: full-vault substring search with context.
- `search_query`: structured Markdown search by path glob, tag, frontmatter equality, and content substring.
- `find_asset_references`: read-only reference analysis for one or more asset paths with conservative `trashSafety`.
- `asset_audit`: read-only directory-level asset audit combining detailed listing and reference analysis.
- `tag_list`: list tags with counts, including nested tag parent counts.
- `append_to_inbox`: append content to a note under the default inbox directory.
- `vault_import_file`: transfer a host-provided file into any allowed vault-relative file path with size/SHA-256 verification and protected overwrite semantics.
- `vault_export_file`: return any allowed vault file as an embedded MCP binary resource for host-side materialization.
- `vault_create_external_reference_note`: create a structured note that references external files without uploading them.

Destructive tools are intentionally exposed because the operator accepts that risk. The server still blocks absolute paths, `..`, symlink escape, temp files, and sensitive vault internals such as `.obsidian/`, `.livesync/`, `.git/`, `.trash/`, and `node_modules/`.

## Implementation Notes

- Full-file `vault_read` returns content, metadata, and a `revision`. `revision.sha256` is calculated from the exact on-disk bytes without Markdown, newline, Unicode, or encoding normalization. Targeted reads keep returning the selected target value.
- `vault_list_detailed` distinguishes missing paths, files, empty directories, non-empty directories, denied paths, and skipped entries. It can recurse and optionally compute SHA-256 hashes.
- `find_asset_references` supports Obsidian wikilinks, Markdown image links, and common HTML `<img src>` references. It ignores fenced code blocks and inline code. It reports `scanCompleteness`, `candidateOrphan`, `trashSafety`, evidence, and warnings.
- `asset_audit` is read-only and does not move, delete, or rewrite files. It combines `vault_list_detailed` and `find_asset_references`; `candidateOrphan=true` means no supported structured reference was found, while `trashSafety=safe` is only returned for full-vault scans with no references, ambiguity, unresolved matches, unsupported matches, duplicates, or relevant warnings. Uncertain cases return `trashSafety=unknown`.
- `vault_write` keeps the legacy upsert behavior. New callers should use `vault_create_note` or `vault_replace_note`; create-only commits use a same-directory temporary file and a hard-link no-replace operation.
- `vault_append` creates missing Markdown files and preserves existing content; optional `expectedSha256` detects concurrent changes.
- `vault_patch` supports heading, block, and frontmatter targets with `replace`, `prepend`, and `append`; it also supports `createTargetIfMissing`, `rejectIfContentPreexists`, `trimTargetWhitespace`, `targetDelimiter`, `contentType`, and `targetScope`.
- Duplicate heading paths currently follow `markdown-patch` map behavior: the later matching heading wins. Prefer unique heading paths when using `vault_patch` or pass a more specific nested path.
- `vault_delete` deletes vault files and empty directories. WAL-backed file deletes return an `operationId`; empty-directory deletes and deployments without WAL finish synchronously without a temporary ID.
- `vault_move` supports destination directories ending in `/` and optional overwrite. Overwrite uses one atomic rename without deleting the destination first. WAL-backed moves return an `operationId` queryable through `vault_get_operation`.
- `vault_import_file` does not use a MIME allowlist. It streams the host-authorized source into a bounded spool, verifies optional `expectedSha256`/`expectedSize`, then atomically commits exact bytes into an existing vault directory.
- Importing over different existing content requires both `allowOverwrite=true` and `expectedDestinationSha256`. Identical content is an idempotent success. Existing content is backed up before replacement when `BACKUP_BEFORE_WRITE=true`.
- `vault_export_file` emits an embedded MCP resource and verifies SHA-256/size. Embedded exports are hard-capped at 4 MiB; oversized files fail instead of being truncated or exposed through a public URL.
- `vault_create_external_reference_note` is for NAS, cloud drive, ticket, PDF, Word, Excel, zip, or log bundle references that should not be stored in the vault.
- `search_simple` returns all matches per file with filename/content source and context.
- `search_query` searches Markdown files with path glob, tag, frontmatter equality, and content substring filters.
- `tag_list` scans frontmatter tags and inline tags, including parent counts for nested tags.

### Interface reliability contract

- Unknown tool names and inputSchema failures return JSON-RPC `-32602`; domain failures after execution starts return `isError=true` with a structured `error`.
- `expectedSha256` is checked against raw bytes while holding the same path lock used for the mutation, and the new revision is generated before releasing that lock. The current lock is process-local, so production keeps one MCP replica.
- WAL commit level is derived only from facts: `remoteVerifiedAt` means remote, `localCommittedAt` means local, cancelled with neither means none, and every other missing-timestamp state means unknown.
- `remote` means the Controller completed LiveSync synchronization and post-sync `livesync-cli info` checks; it does not claim direct CouchDB revision verification.
- `OPERATION_NOT_FOUND` may also mean the record exceeded retention or WAL storage is unavailable.

## File Transfer

`vault_import_file` uses the host file-parameter channel rather than Base64 inside ordinary MCP arguments. In ChatGPT, `tools/list` advertises `_meta["openai/fileParams"] = ["file"]`, so ChatGPT supplies an authorized temporary file reference. The server downloads it into a bounded spool, computes SHA-256 and byte size, and commits it without byte conversion.

Recommended integrity-sensitive import:

```json
{
  "file": "<host file>",
  "destination": "Projects/assets/original.pdf",
  "expectedSha256": "<64 hex characters>",
  "expectedSize": 91353
}
```

Replacing different existing content is deliberately stricter:

```json
{
  "file": "<host file>",
  "destination": "Projects/assets/original.pdf",
  "allowOverwrite": true,
  "expectedDestinationSha256": "<current destination SHA-256>"
}
```

`vault_export_file` returns an embedded MCP binary resource. The hard export ceiling is 4 MiB because the blob is Base64-encoded at the MCP protocol layer and host materialization has a practical size ceiling. There is no resource-link/public-URL fallback.

## Run

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/vault/98-Inbox/assets
npm run build
MCP_TOKEN=change-me VAULT_ROOT=/tmp/vault npm start
```

The configured inbox must already exist. Note and file-import tools never create parent directories implicitly.

## Safety Model

The server allows destructive tools when enabled, but still enforces baseline file safety:

- no absolute paths;
- no `..` path traversal;
- no symlink escape from the vault root;
- no access to `.obsidian/`, `.livesync/`, `.git/`, `.trash/`, `.backups`, or `node_modules/`;
- no temp/swap files;
- no writes directly in the vault root;
- no implicit parent-directory creation by note, file-import, or move tools;
- explicit `vault_create_directory` creates one level only, requires a reason, and is intended only after inspecting existing directories; an empty parent creates a new top-level directory;
- startup validation for the configured inbox when inbox capture is enabled;
- generic attachment import is allowed only through `vault_import_file`, with vault path checks, bounded transfer size, optional source integrity checks, and protected overwrite semantics;
- embedded file export is hard-capped at 4 MiB and never falls back to a public download URL;
- per-file locks for write, append, patch, import, export, move, and delete;
- atomic writes with temp file, fsync, and rename;
- default trash deletes and backup-before-write recovery copies;
- JSON audit logs for mutating operations.

## Test

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The test suite starts the HTTP MCP server and covers all exposed tools, authentication failure, path traversal rejection, sensitive directory rejection, symlink escape rejection, missing-parent rejection without directory creation, root-write rejection, write-root allowlists, overwrite move behavior, patch variants, image asset validation, external reference note creation, search multi-match behavior, and tag aggregation.

It also runs an official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` Streamable HTTP client compatibility test that verifies published `outputSchema`, structured success output, and calls including `vault_read`, `vault_write`, and `search_simple`.

Additional split tests cover per-file concurrent append locking and Markdown/YAML boundary cases including complex frontmatter, Unicode headings, fenced code blocks, duplicate heading behavior, CRLF input, and table patching via `markdown-patch`.

## Protocol Compatibility

Tested with:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `^1.29.0`
- Streamable HTTP client transport
- Bearer token authentication
- OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel with ChatGPT Connector in a personal full-access k3s deployment

Supported JSON-RPC methods:

- `initialize`
- `ping`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`

## Build

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/3011/obsidian-vault-mcp:main .
docker push ghcr.io/3011/obsidian-vault-mcp:main
```

GitHub Actions publishes `main` and immutable `sha-*` images for pushes to `main`. Tags matching `v*` publish the git tag, semantic-version aliases, `latest`, and a GitHub Release.

> GitHub Container Registry packages under personal accounts are private on first publish. To allow anonymous pulls from `ghcr.io/3011/obsidian-vault-mcp`, change the package visibility to **Public** in GitHub Package settings.

## Kubernetes Example

Split manifests and Chinese deployment notes are available under `deploy/`; see `deploy/README.zh-CN.md`.
For the recommended LiveSync + MCP + private tunnel topology, see `docs/deployment-architecture.md`.

```bash
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE create secret generic obsidian-vault-mcp-token \
  --from-literal=MCP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE apply -k deploy/default
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE rollout status deploy/obsidian-vault-mcp
```

## Personal Full-Access Tunnel

For pure personal use where ChatGPT is intentionally allowed to use every vault tool, use the full-access tunnel profile:

```bash
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE apply -k deploy/personal-full-access
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE rollout status deploy/obsidian-vault-mcp
```

This profile sets `MCP_REQUIRE_TOKEN=false`, `READ_ONLY=false`, and enables write, append, patch, delete, move, inbox append, generic file transfer, and external reference note tools. It assumes the MCP server is only reachable through a private tunnel such as OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel, with the tunnel upstream pointed at:

```text
http://obsidian-vault-mcp:80/mcp
```

See `docs/personal-full-access.md` before using this profile with a primary vault.

The generic file-transfer path is covered by automated import/export integrity, overwrite-safety, size-limit, symlink/path-boundary, embedded-resource, and SDK compatibility tests. Re-run the ChatGPT tunnel matrix after deploying a new image.
